                If communication is about giving and taking information by using
                languages, being a multilingual will be really helpful. No
                doubt. But in this part, I would say my own definition what my
                communication is. What makes us communicate in real meaning?
                Here is my attitude and I hope you will agree with it. ðŸ˜Š

              Honestly, my first semester in Mississppi was total failure. Even
              I was in the US, I thought myself I can't speak English well, and
              it was even impossible to order a Subway sandwitch in the way I
              want. Have you ever tried a sandwitch only with teriyaki chicken
              and spinach? I would never forget the moment that the clerk told
              me that "Hey.. Are you sure?".

              I was so overwhelmed and I had to overcome it. Fortunately, I
              could find a way to solve the problem thorough communication. When
              a new semester started, I decided to go outside and participate in
              a speech club, Toastmasters international. I was the only Asian in
              the club, and maybe the first Asian in the history of the club ðŸ˜„.
              Speaking in front of audiences was painful. Also in my case,
              speaking foreign language doubled the damage. My ears was getting
              red, and my sight blurred and I could not see anything.
            </h1>
            <h1>
              The experience was awful, but I did not give up my decision.
              Although I was not good speaker, I tried to show my mind to
              communicate with people in the room. Everyone in the club always
              supported my challenge, and I could gradually develop my speaking
              skill. I was just able to say a sentence for weeks, but it became
              small talks, and finally enlarged as speeches for over one year of
              my journey. At the last semester, I was in charge of one corner,
              the impromptu speaking session, and encouraged members to
              participate into the session.
            </h1>
            <h1>
              Without opening the door to club room, and motivations from my
              friends, I would not survive. On the basis of the experience, I
              always push myself to meet new people and new environment. Yes
              nothing is same, and it is always nervous to do something new. But
              I can approach first. My communication is opening the door,
              approach first, and not giving up.
