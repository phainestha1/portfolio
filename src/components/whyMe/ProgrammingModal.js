                Honestly, I want to start my own business but don't have money
                to hire engineers. So I started programming by myself with
                Javascript.
                <br />
                But it is interesting that one of my best readings, Í∂åÎèÑÍ∑†Ïùò
                Ïä§ÌÉÄÌä∏ÏóÖ Í≤ΩÏòÅ ÏàòÏóÖ, mentions the same way as mine. Here's the
                thing. If you or your co-founder have no main technology or
                knowledge for your business, you should not start a company. So
                it was the fact that I was starting my programming life because
                of the money issue, it was also fortunate signal that I am doing
                right thing!

              We use same language but understand different things. In my last
              job, office and depot had go through same problems. So I always
              monitored several times whether my requests are going well, or I
              am understanding messages from depot without any missing points.
              Including this field, the world with people may 100% same :P..
              Thus I am a super person toward the importance of communication.
              <br />
              On the basis of my selfstudy, I can read and understand codes even
              it would take some times. Maybe it would be hard to read codes if
              it was written in languages I don't know such as Haskell, C#, or
              Solidity. But I know the essential meaning of communication and
              eager to talk with engineers. I'll never say like "Oh, I don't
              know this but believe in you." This is not delegation nor somethig
              like teamwork.
